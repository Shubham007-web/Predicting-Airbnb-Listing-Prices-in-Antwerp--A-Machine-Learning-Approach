# Airbnb Price Prediction in Antwerp, Belgium üè°üí∞

## Introduction
Dive into the heart of Antwerp's Airbnb market with this comprehensive data science project. Our mission is to harness machine learning to illuminate the factors driving Airbnb listing prices, providing hosts with insights to optimize their pricing strategies and enhance their competitiveness.

## Project Scope üåê
In the bustling city of Antwerp, where history meets modernity, Airbnb hosts face the challenge of pricing their listings attractively while ensuring profitability. This project employs a multi-faceted approach to predict listing prices, leveraging detailed datasets and advanced analytics to uncover the intricacies of the local Airbnb ecosystem.

## Data Exploration üìä
Our analytical journey is fueled by four rich datasets, each offering a unique lens on the Airbnb experience:
- **Calendar.csv**: Tracks daily listing prices and availability, revealing the rhythm of demand throughout the year.
- **Listings.csv**: Provides an in-depth look at each listing, including amenities, location, and host details, painting a comprehensive picture of what influences prices.
- **Hosts.csv**: Delves into the profiles of Airbnb hosts, shedding light on how host characteristics might affect listing appeal and pricing.
- **Reviews.csv**: Captures guest feedback, offering a glimpse into the guest experience and its impact on a listing's value.


## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Initial Data Exploration**: Identifying key features within each dataset and understanding the structure and quality of the data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to refine the datasets for analysis.

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
- **Insightful Analytics**: Conducting a thorough examination of the datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Transforming raw data into informative features that capture the nuances influencing listing prices.

### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling
- **Model Selection**: Experimentation with various regression models to identify the most effective approach for price prediction.
- **Model Optimization and Validation**: Fine-tuning model parameters and validating model performance to ensure reliability and accuracy.
