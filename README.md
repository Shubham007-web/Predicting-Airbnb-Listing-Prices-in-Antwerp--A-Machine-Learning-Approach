# Airbnb Price Prediction in Antwerp, Belgium

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the prices of Airbnb listings in Antwerp, Belgium. By leveraging detailed Airbnb data, the goal is to provide hosts with insights on optimal pricing strategies, enhancing their competitiveness and maximizing earnings while ensuring affordability for guests.

## Business Case
The Airbnb market in Antwerp is dynamic, with prices fluctuating based on various factors such as location, amenities, property type, and time of year. This project addresses the need for a data-driven approach to price setting, enabling hosts to make informed decisions that align with market trends and guest expectations.

## Datasets
The analysis is based on four main datasets:
- **Calendar.csv:** Daily price and availability information for listings over a year.
- **Listings.csv:** Comprehensive details on listings, including location, amenities, and host information.
- **Hosts.csv:** Data on hosts, including their ID, name, and listing descriptions.
- **Reviews.csv:** Customer reviews, providing insights into guest experiences and satisfaction.

## Tasks and Methodology
The project is divided into several key tasks:
1. **Data Understanding and Feature Creation**
   - Analysis of the calendar data to understand listing availability and pricing trends.
   - Transformation of the price column for model suitability.
   - Examination of listings, hosts, and reviews data for feature engineering.
   - Aggregation of a comprehensive dataset for modeling.

2. **Data Quality Checks**
   - Auditing the aggregated dataset for data quality, including checks for missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
   - Generating a data quality report with detailed statistics for continuous and categorical variables.

3. **Variable Profiling and Relationship Analysis**
   - Profiling variables to understand their distribution and impact on listing prices.
   - Exploring relationships between target and predictor variables to refine the feature set.

4. **Modeling and Insights**
   - Implementing and comparing various regression models to predict listing prices.
   - Identifying and interpreting the top predictors of listing prices.
   - Finalizing the model based on performance metrics and providing actionable insights.
